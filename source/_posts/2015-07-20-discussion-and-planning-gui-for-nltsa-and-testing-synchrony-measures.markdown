We are trying to converge to an easy and clear design of the GUI of our toolbox that integrates in CPACâ€™s structure and allows users to use it. We are trying here to avoid redundant options in the workflow and it is becoming a quite difficult task, since we want the measures to be separated in differentiated subgroups, but at the same time, give the toolbox the possibility of using common functions (such as the extraction of the timeseries). It has to be non-redundant in this way, the most complicated thing will be the correct use of data structures (to take the ones that are already being generated from other modules in CPAC and to check if the series of a volume had been already extracted, in order to do not duplicate efforts). The design has to be generalizable enough that it can be used in other workflows.

## ** Synchrony measures in ADHD data **

#### ** aaa **

As we are trying not to evaluate our measures at the end, this week we have tried extensively our data in the dataset from ADHD200 (specific information about the dataset and how we  did our first systematic efforts to test workflows integrally with fMRI data and find if the results were coherent with the technique.



Maybe we can talk at some point soon about developers thoughts on this.
